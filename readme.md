tl;dr You are standing on a planet and are encircled by three stars dancing in a "Three-body problem".
The star system is not unlike Alpha Centauri. And the whole setting is not unlike the book "The Three-Body Problem" by Liu Cixin.

### Before you read this:

### Be Adviced:
This won't make a lot of Sense unless you've read the Three-Body Experiment by ...
The following contains * SPOILERS *

### Here is the part without spoiling to much.

You're looking at a star-system containing three stars in close proximity. Not unlike
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri Alpha Centauri, our closest galactic neighbor.

You are watching three stars circling each other. Now in Mathematics there is a curiosity
that is called the ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem ) *Three-body problem*

Two objects circling each other is quite predictable, but a system THREE objects circling
each other can not be predicted.

> In physics and classical mechanics, the three-body problem is the problem of taking an initial set of data that specifies the positions, masses, and velocities of three bodies for some particular point in time and then determining the motions of the three bodies, in accordance with Newton's laws of motion and of universal gravitation which are the laws of classical mechanics. The three-body problem is a special case of the n-body problem.

You are standing on a planet, encircling three stars dancing in a Three-body-problem. Not unlike Alpha Centauri
